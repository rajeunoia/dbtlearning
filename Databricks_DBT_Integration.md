h2. üßæ Conclusion: DBT Job Execution in Databricks

Databricks provides multiple patterns to execute DBT workflows, but only some are production-grade. Below is a classification of valid patterns, their purpose, and rationale for inclusion/exclusion.

h3. ‚úÖ Production-Grade Patterns

|| Pattern || Execution || Trigger || Notes ||
| *P1 ‚Äì Notebook `%sh` cell* | Runs `dbt run` in a notebook shell cell | Manual / Scheduled Workflow | Simple and useful for dev/test, but limited |
| *P2 ‚Äì Python Wheel Task*   | Packaged DBT project as Python wheel    | Databricks Job / Workflow    | Recommended for production pipelines       |
| *P3 ‚Äì Bash Script Task*    | DBT run via shell script in DBFS        | Databricks Job / Workflow    | Lightweight, script-friendly alternative   |
| *P4 ‚Äì External Orchestrator ‚Üí Job API* | External trigger to a defined Databricks Job | Airflow / CI/CD / Event Trigger | Enterprise orchestration and param support |

*Note:* All of the above *require a Databricks Job* to be production-grade.

h3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Technically Valid, but Not Production-Grade

|| Pattern || Why Not Production-Grade ||
| *Notebook Manual Execution* | No retries, no scheduling, no isolation, no monitoring |
| *One-off `%sh` command runs* | Cannot be reused, lacks observability and alerting |

h3. ‚ùå Omitted / Redundant Patterns

|| Pattern || Why Omitted ||
| *P5 ‚Äì `databricks-cli` trigger* | Not a unique execution model ‚Äì it's just a wrapper over the Job API |
| *P6 ‚Äì Dockerized CI/CD DBT run* | Runs outside Databricks compute; violates constraint of being Databricks-native |
| *P4 duplicate of P2/P3* | External triggers (Pattern 4) only initiate a Databricks Job, not a new run mode |

h3. üß† Final Notes

* Databricks Jobs are *mandatory* for any scalable, monitored, and automated production DBT pipeline.
* The choice between *Python Wheel (P2)* and *Bash Task (P3)* depends on team maturity and packaging practices.
* External orchestrators (*P4*) only *trigger* jobs ‚Äî they don‚Äôt replace them.

h3. üîÅ Final Summary: How DBT Jobs Are Triggered on Databricks

# The two ways to programmatically start a Databricks Job are:
## *Job API* and *databricks-cli*

# These Jobs can run DBT using:
## *Notebook tasks*, *Python Wheel tasks*, or *Shell (Bash) tasks*

# These jobs can be triggered from:
## *Databricks Workflows (manually or scheduled)*, *external orchestrators (Airflow, CI/CD)*, or *scripts using CLI/API*
